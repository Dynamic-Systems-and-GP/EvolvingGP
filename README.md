# EvolvingGP
Evolving Gaussian process (EGP) modelling is an extension of GP modelling to evolving systems. Such implementation facilitates sequential model adaptation to incoming data stream.

Installation instructions:
* Download the [GPML toolbox](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) and unpack into a separate folder inside the Evolving GP directory
* Run the script EvolvingGP/startup.m
